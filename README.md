Backend:
- `npm start` or `ts-node server.ts` to run backend on localhost:8080
- `nodemon` to real time running backend on localhost:8080 in development mode

To do:
- Create `handling errors` after "sign up" implementing (4/14)
- Rethink `unused parameter next` in router methods
- Think about `type` of userId in `articles` and `notes` schemas
- Check out `deleting` articles and notes with deleting user
- Create `PUT` method for user
- Create history of transactions (all methods)
- Add `find()` method in PUT methods
