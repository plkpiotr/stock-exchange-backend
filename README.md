Backend:
- `npm start` or `ts-node server.ts` to run backend on localhost:8080
- `nodemon` to real time running backend on localhost:8080 in development mode

To do:
- Create `handling errors` after "sign up" implementing (4/14)
- Think about `methods name` in `app.ts` after mongoDB configuration
- Rethink `unused parameter next` in router methods
- Reconsider `required` properties in `mongoose.Schema`
- Think about `type` of userId in `articles` and `notes` schemas (`mongoose.Types.ObjectId`)
- Add `link validation` in `article` schema
- Delete `console.log` - especially in routes methods
